# SE2_KSP_project
Created by Kim Lam, Sydney Ross, and Рatrick Сour. This is our Software Engineering 2 Repo for our project KSP. 

This project revolves around the idea of finding and connecting with peers on a college campus. Due to the current Covid-19 Pandemic, in addition to other personal factors, it is hard for college students to connect with others and form meaningful friendships. As college students ourselves, we think a "friend finder" application would help mitigate this problem, especially for commuting students on LTU's campus. 

The project utilizes Python's Flask and PyMongo modules to create a web application in HTML with a NoSQL DB.

Steps:
1. Install MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/
2. Install Python
3. Use python to install the packages: cryptography, flask, pymongo
4. To install the packages, type "pip install (package)" in a terminal.
5. Run server.py and go to localhost
