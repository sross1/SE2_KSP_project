# SE2_KSP_project
Created by Kim Lam, Sydney Ross, and Patrick Cour. This is our Software Engineering 2 Repo for our project KSP. 

This project revolves around the idea of finding and connecting with peers on a college campus. Due to the current Covid-19 Pandemic, in addition to other personal factors, it is sometimes hard for college studentst to connect with others and form meaningful friendships. As college students ourselves, we think a "friend finder" application would help mitigate this problem, especially for commuting students on LTU's campus. 

It is a mix of Python and HTML in order to form this MVP model of the webapp.
